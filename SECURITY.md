## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL].

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

### Required Information

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability**
- **The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)**
- **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)**
- **Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it**

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## What to Expect

### Timeline

- **48 hours**: Initial response to your report
- **7 days**: Status update and initial assessment
- **30 days**: Target for resolution and disclosure

### Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. **Confirm the problem** and determine affected versions
2. **Audit code** to find any similar problems
3. **Prepare fixes** for all supported versions
4. **Release new versions** with security fixes
5. **Disclose the vulnerability** to the community

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch releases (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) for the latest supported version. We will also backport security fixes to older supported versions when possible.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep updated**: Always use the latest stable version
- **Review permissions**: Only grant necessary permissions to the workflow
- **Monitor executions**: Regularly check execution logs for unusual activity
- **Secure credentials**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
- **Network security**: Ensure your n8n instance is not publicly accessible

### For Contributors

- **Code review**: All code changes must be reviewed for security issues
- **Dependency updates**: Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Error handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
- **Testing**: Test security-related changes thoroughly

## Security Features

This workflow includes several security features:

### Credential Management
- Uses n8n's built-in credential system
- No hardcoded secrets in the workflow
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration

### API Security
- Secure token-based authentication
- HTTPS-only API calls
- Minimal required permissions

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data logging
- Secure data transmission
- Access control through n8n permissions

## Security Checklist

Before deploying this workflow to production:

- [ ] Review and update all environment variables
- [ ] Verify API permissions are minimal and necessary
- [ ] Test error handling and logging
- [ ] Ensure n8n instance is properly secured
- [ ] Review network access controls
- [ ] Verify credential storage security
- [ ] Test with sample data first
